- - C01 What is HPC?
  - Before you can use larger resources, you need to understand the
    difference from your own computers

- - C20 Modules and software

  - Using and installing software on a cluster is different from
    your own computer, because hundreds of people are sharing it.
    Modules are the solution.

- - C21 Slurm

  - On a cluster, you have to share resources with others.  Slurm
    is one batch queuing system that makes it possible.

- - C22 HPC Storage

  - Storage turns out to be just as important as computing power.
    There are different places available, each with different
    advantages.

- - C23 Parallel computing

  - The point of a cluster is to run things in parallel.  How does
    this work?
  -
  - See :doc:`training by Science-IT <by-science-it>`, and
    :doc:`../triton/tut/parallel`.


- - C24 Advanced shell scripting and automation

  - Hands-on shell scripting, putting everything together to
    automate large computations on the cluster.
  -
  - Various courses,
    finishing the :doc:`linux shell tutorial
    <linux-shell-tutorial>` is a good start.
